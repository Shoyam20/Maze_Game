# Maze_Game
An implementation of an Intelligent Maze Solver developed as part of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. The project focuses on graph representation of mazes, state tracking, and performance comparison of classical and advanced pathfinding algorithms to determine the most optimal solution strategy.
